## [Gender Critical Survey Results](/assets/gender-critical-survey-results.pdf)

We surveyed our members to find out their views on three questions regarding the expression of ‘gender-critical’ beliefs in the workplace, and you can see the results here. We asked them if the expression of these views would cause them to experience harassment, defined by s.26 of the Equality Act 2010 as behaviour that would create an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment. The results reflect the views of 167 members, which might sound small, but if you wanted to conduct a survey of the general public that reached 167 trans people, you would have to survey 33,400 people!

This will help us understand the extent of bullying, harassment and discrimination across the Civil Service. This tool is not a replacement for reporting to your HR team.
