We help Civil Service departments and agencies provide a safe and welcoming environment for trans and intersex colleagues by:

* creating and delivering *workplace training and awareness sessions* across the Civil Service
* provide *expert advice, guidance and support* to staff and policy owners across the Civil Service to develop their trans and intersex inclusive policy
* producing and regularly updating our *workplace guide* to basic compliance requirements and best practice for staff and managers
* attending and liaising on *internal meetings* with Civil Service departments and *external meetings* on behalf of the Civil Service, such as with providers of support for trans and intersex people (e.g. GIRES, Stonewall, Mermaids)
* offering *advice and support* to all staff through our executive committee and regional representatives
