If you care about equality and respect, and are willing to support and promote a:gender, you’re an ally. 

Our allies stand up for trans and intersex people within the workplace, and play an important role in building the confidence of a:gender members.

Together we can remove barriers and become agents for positive change. Our core values to help raise awareness and develop mutual confidence and understanding are:
- *Listen*: please, hear our stories and respect our lives
- *Learn*: understand the diversity of trans identities and intersex variations
- *Speak*: we need you as an ally to help challenge transphobia
​​​
## What you can do
Here are some of the ways our allies help us: 
- Spread the word about a:gender
- Promote our events 
- Represent a:gender at events 
- Suggest that a:gender runs an awareness session for your department
- Write a blog post 
- Display and distribute stickers, coasters, lanyards and contact cards at your workplace

## Everyday support
The small things you do and say in the workplace can make a big difference.

### Be yourself

### Don't worry
If you’re not sure how to address someone, or you make a mistake with pronouns, simply apologise and ask what they prefer. Having a conversation helps people feel they can be themselves.
 
### Take action
Share with your colleagues and workforce why trans and intersex equality is important. Your Diversity & Inclusion Team can help you share a:gender’s vision.

 
### Stand up
Challenge transphobic ‘banter’ among colleagues. Encourage diversity questions to be raised and discussed in a safe space.
 
### Ask for help
Don’t feel isolated. Ask our regional reps, or a member of the executive committee, for information and advice.
