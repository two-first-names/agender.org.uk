“I didn’t know much about transgender, non-binary and intersex people or what a lot of the words around the terms meant. And I never considered what it must feel like, on a day-to-day basis, to deal with the issues that many trans people face. But when I found myself closely working with the a:gender network, it allowed me to see into their world, and see the challenges that people faced every day, at work and at home. 

In the short time that I was with them, I have learned so much and worked to help them to raise awareness at specific events. I’d like to think that I am a better person for this experience. There can never be too many allies.”
