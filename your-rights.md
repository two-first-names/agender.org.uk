Gender Recognition Act 2004
---------------------------

The Gender Recognition Act gives transsexual people legal recognition of their preferred gender. 

The Gender Recognition Panel, a body made up of judicially trained lawyers and doctors, issues a Gender Recognition Certificate (GRC) when they are satisfied that an applicant:

*   has or has had gender dysphoria
    
*   has lived in the acquired gender throughout the preceding two years
    
*   intends to continue to live in the acquired gender until death

GDPR & Human Rights Act 1998
----------------------------

All information about an individual’s gender history or gender reassignment is classed as sensitive data under the GDPR, and can only be processed for specific reasons listed in the Act.

  
Article 8 of the Human Rights Act gives everyone, including transgender people, the right to privacy and family life.

Equality Act 2010
-----------------

The Equality Act 2010 covers nine protected characteristics, including gender reassignment. It brings together a number of earlier discrimination acts and regulations.

  
Gender reassignment was previously covered by the Sex Discrimination Act. The Equality Act 2010 strengthens the principles set out in the previous Act.

The Workplace and Gender Reassignment
-------------------------------------

The Workplace and Gender Reassignment is published by a:gender, and gives general advice to civil servants about transsexualism and gender reassignment issues relevant to Civil Service employees.

  
This guide is designed to help civil servants provide a working environment that meets the needs of transsexual people, supports their aspirations and improves life chances for them and their families. 

The Workplace and Gender Reassignment is currently being updated, and has been removed from GOV.UK for the time being.

*   declaring a disability or health condition
    
*   who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender (LGB or T)
    
The Talent Action Plan is part of the ongoing Civil Service Reform programme. It was published in 2014.
