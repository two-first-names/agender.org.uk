We are a support network for trans and intersex staff across the Civil Service. We help our members flourish by: 
- offering *advice and support* through our executive committee and regional representatives
- providing *information* through our website
- holding an *annual conference* 
- holding formal and informal events where members can *network and socialise safely*
- regularly sending *newsletters and other communications* to keep our members informed
